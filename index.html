                    <h3>Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish</h3>
                    <p>"Stay hungry, stay foolish" is a phrase coined by Steve Jobs in his famous Stanford University commencement speech in 2005. The phrase 
                        encourages people to maintain a sense of curiosity and hunger for knowledge, and to never become complacent or satisfied with their 
                        current level of understanding. Jobs believed that staying foolish meant being open to new ideas and taking risks, even if it meant 
                        failing along the way. By staying hungry and foolish, individuals can continue to learn and grow throughout their lives, and can ultimately
                         achieve their fullest potential. The phrase has become a popular mantra
                         for those seeking to embrace innovation and creativity, and to pursue their passions with a sense of fearlessness and determination.

                    <h3>DO MORE.</h3>
                    <p>"Do more" is a simple but powerful phrase that can inspire individuals to push themselves beyond their limits and achieve their goals. It encourages people to take action and make the most of every opportunity that comes their way. By doing more, individuals can build their skills, knowledge, and experience, and unlock their full potential. Doing more can also mean going above and beyond what is expected, whether in one's personal or professional life. By embracing 
                        the "do more" mindset, individuals can live a more fulfilling and rewarding life, and make a positive impact on the world
                         around them.</p>
